# Dev Box Setup
## Enable the Dev Box Service
Once you enter the Microsoft Dev Box page in Azure, you will first need to run a script to complete the last step of enabling the private preview.  
Click on ‘Get Script’ and run this script in your Azure terminal. 
## Create a Dev Center
Click on ‘Dev Centers’ in the left hand panel to begin Dev Center creation. Fill in the basics. 
You will notice that you can enable the Microsoft Hosted Network when viewing your Dev Center Settings. If you do not plan to use MHN, you can skip selecting this capability. Otherwise, select MHN to avoid Custom Network Creation. 
Add appropriate tags, and click on “Review + Create” to create your Dev Center.
