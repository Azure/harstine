# Pre-requisites for enabling Project Harstine

To set up the private preview for Project Harstine, you will first need to enable a set of pre-requisites. 

You will need to do the following: 
1.	*Access to the Private Preview documentation for project Harstine* (wahoo! You have already completed this step). 
2.	A tenant where you are a Tenant-level admin. 
- If you are using an older tenant (aka, you are not creating a new tenant for this preview), ensure that you increase your Entra device limits to create Dev Boxes. 
3.	A new Azure subscription within this Tenant with Owner and Contributor access. 
4.	*Contact the Dev Box engineering team to enable the Private Preview* for your organization (wahoo! This step is already complete if you have access to this documentation). 
- You will need to provide your subscription ID when contacting the Dev Box team. 
- You should see "Project Harstine" when looking up the Harstine service overview a few minutes after you get access. 
5.	*Windows 10/11 Enterprise license, Microsoft Intune License, and a Microsoft Entra ID P1 License.* 
- Configure Microsoft Intune and Entra for your team. 
- We recommend using a Windows 11 license since Windows 10 licenses reached end of support on October 14th 2025.
